In general, additions to this mod should follow these principles:

- Vanilla First
  - If there's ever a conflict between supporting a "vanilla+SVC" playthrough vs supporting a mod, choose vanilla first.
  - Exapmle: a change that fixes a modded boat but breaks a vanilla one should be rejected
- Precise Inputs, Imprecise Outputs
  - Sailwind lets players make tiny adjustments to heading, wheel, cargo placement, and the like, but generally relies on "gut feel" and imprecise reading of analog devices to get information back. 
  - Whenever crew gather information for the player, it should have a similar "fuzzy" feeling
  - Example: The lookout can see islands, but generally reports their heading at secondary intercardinal resolution (e.g. ESE, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction)
- Tune for Fun, not Simulation
  - Rule of Thumb: a player should be able to support a "full crew" on a Vanilla medium vessel without going broke or having to fill the whole vessel with food & water
    - Example: Crew have very low standing salaries, and take a % of profit rather than % of revenue, so you can still make economic progress even if you make some mistakes.
  - It's fine to add extra difficulty for the masochists, just include it behind a high-level toggle.
	- A current example is that crew don't get extra tired when working, as it would require a huge crew for small vessels. But for people running megaships and who want three shifts, they can toggle it on.
- The Player is the Best
  - The player sets the standard for what the crew can do. Nobody should be able to operate winches quicker, run faster, see further, etc... than the player.

For any changes, fork this repository and submit a PR. Test against vanilla ships in-game. (Even if you're making a mod-only change, do a sanity check on 1-2 vanilla vessels)
